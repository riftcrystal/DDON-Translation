# DDO-Translation
This is a repository for the translation of Dragon's Dogma Online.

This is a community translation project.

Many of our translations are taken from the great team over at the [Dragon's Dogma Online Translations](http://ddonline.tumblr.com/) and [their wiki](http://ddon.wikidot.com/). These sites are also great for reference if you are a console player.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the translation patch, please feel free to open a pull request or contact [/u/Crevox on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Crevox).

If you are new to Git or version control please take some time to [read through GitHub's guide on using Git](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/).

When doing translation please open up your own branch for your changes. When you feel that your edits are ready for review, please open a pull request to have your branch merged into master. This lets people see your request along with the changes, and allows everyone to comment/feedback on it before merging. If you are unsure of how branching works please read the GitHub wiki or other guides on Git branching.

Each XML file has an entry for the original Japanese text encased in an &lt;original xml:space="preserve"&gt;&lt;/original&gt; tag. When entering in your translation simply press enter to make a new line and encase your translated text in a &lt;translation xml:space="preserve"&gt;&lt;/translation&gt; tag. If you are unsure of what this looks like please take a look at some files that have already been translated to see an example.

If you have any questions, feel free to [PM me on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Crevox) and I will try my best to answer them.
